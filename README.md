# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-using-CNN
CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN  A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow /Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.
Features
📦 Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset

🧩 Builds a compact CNN with Conv2D, BatchNormalization, and Dropout layers

⚙️ Trains the model with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss

📊 Evaluates model accuracy and prints a classification report

🐕 Allows custom image upload & prediction (supports Google Colab upload dialog)

Result:
| Metric        | Value                      |
